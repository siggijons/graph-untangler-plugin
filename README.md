# Graph Untangler Plugin

# Integration
1. Add plugin to the root `build.gradle`
```groovy
// build.gradle
plugins {
  id 'net.siggijons.gradle.graphuntangler' version 0.0.4
}
```

See also: https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/net.siggijons.gradle.graphuntangler

# Usage

## Analyze Module Graph
```bash
./gradlew analyzeModuleGraph
```

### Known Issues
Does not play well with configuration cache and up-to-date checks appear to be off for the same
reason of not treating the `Project` as an input.

Workaround is to run without configuration cache and re-run tasks 
```bash
./gradlew analyzeModuleGraph --no-configuration-cache --rerun
```

## Calculate Module Change Freqency
```bash
./gradlew generateChangeFrequencyFile
```

This command assumes git is being used as SCV and will run `git log` commands via bash to calculate the change frequency for each module in the project.

By default, the command looks at 28 days back from today. This behavior can be overwritten with properties:

```bash
./gradlew generateChangeFrequencyFile -Pfrequency-start=2021-12-10 -Pfrequency-days=14 --info
```

This will look at 14 days back from 2021-12-10.

Note: the task uses `git log --follow --format=oneline --since=<date>`, so implicitly assumes that the current `HEAD` is at `frequency-start` for the lookback.
The idea is to use support something like this to look back in time:

```bash
# Analyze Graph like it was on 2021-12-13
git checkout `git rev-list -n 1 --before="2021-12-13 00:00" HEAD`
./gradlew generateChangeFrequencyFile -Pfrequency-start=2021-12-13 -Pfrequency-days=28
./gradlew analyzeModuleGraph
```


See `GenerateChangeFrequencyTask` for more details.

## Owners
**Experimental**

Module owner information can be included in analysis by providing an `owners.yaml` file using the following format:

```yaml
app:
  team: App
  modules:
    - :app
    - :feature:settings
feature:
  team: Feature
  modules:
    - :feature:foryou
    - :feature:interests
    - :feature:bookmarks
    - :feature:topic
core:
  team: Core
  modules: 
    - :core:common
    - :core:data
    - :core:data-test
    - :core:database
    - :core:datastore
    - :core:datastore-test
    - :core:designsystem
    - :core:domain
    - :core:model
    - :core:network
    - :core:ui
    - :core:testing
    - :core:analytics
    - :sync:work
    - :sync:sync-test
tools:
  team: Tools
  modules:
    - :app-nia-catalog
    - :benchmarks
    - :lint
    - :ui-test-hilt-manifest
```

### GitHub CODEOWNERS
Alternatively (or by default?) the tool will try to parse out module ownership from the 
[`./github/CODEOWNERS`][1] file.

TODO: list out limitations and assumptions like wildcard folding.

```
/app @App
/feature/settings @App

/feature/foryou @Feature
/feature/interests @Feature
/feature/bookmarks @Feature
/feature/topic @Feature

/core @Core
/sync @Core

/app-nia-catalog @Tools
/benchmarks @Tools
/lint @Tools
/ui-test-hilt-manifest @Tools
```

## Outputs

All plugin outputs can be found in the `build/untangler` directory.

Graphs can be rendered using the `dot` command from [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
```bash
dot -Tpng build/untangler/analyzeModuleGraph-height.gv -o analyzeModuleGraph-height.png
```

Alternatively, the dependency graph can be imported into a tool such as [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) for further analysis.

# Development
For development it's convenient to use `includeBuild`. To do so follow these steps:

1. Checkout this repository
2. Add to `settings.gradle`
```bash
includeBuild("/path/to/graph-untangler-plugin")
```

3. Add plugin to root `build.gradle`
```groovy
// build.gradle
plugins {
  id("net.siggijons.gradle.graphuntangler")
}
```
